        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer, with a passion for learning new and exciting programs and be able to utilize them in my day-to-day coding.
I have experience building applications with Ruby on Rails, Python Flask, and JavaScript Express, as well as React and Redux. I am comfortable working in a Full Stack environment and can easily transition from coding in the back end to the front end with ease. Unlike the traditional route, that most Software Engineers undergo I first taught myself to program in python and later decided to join a Bootcamp to learn things that I might've missed when teaching myself to code. When not trying to create the next best thing, Iâ€™m usually working on cars, playing basketball, or improving on my photography!</p>
